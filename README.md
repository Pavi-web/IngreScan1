# IngreScan

## IngreScan: Choose Wisely

IngreScan is a comprehensive skincare solution designed to help users understand their skin type and make informed product choices. Many individuals struggle to find suitable skincare products due to a lack of knowledge about ingredients and their effects. IngreScan bridges this gap by analyzing the user’s skin type based on responses to a simple questionnaire. Once the skin type is identified, the platform provides personalized recommendations, suggesting suitable skincare products and beneficial ingredients while warning against harmful or unsuitable ones. Unlike generic skincare advice, IngreScan ensures that recommendations are tailored to each individual's unique skin concerns, such as dryness, oiliness, sensitivity, or acne-prone conditions.

Additionally, the platform offers the option to consult a dermatologist for expert guidance. This feature allows users to seek professional advice and resolve specific skin concerns more effectively. By providing a seamless way to analyze skin needs and access relevant product recommendations, IngreScan eliminates the confusion and time-consuming research that often comes with choosing the right skincare routine. With IngreScan, users can confidently select products that align with their skin’s requirements, ensuring better skincare decisions and healthier skin.

## How it Works ?
How IngreScan Works
IngreScan is designed to simplify skincare by analyzing skin types and recommending suitable products and ingredients. The process is straightforward and user-friendly, ensuring that users receive personalized skincare advice without any technical complexity.

1. Skin Type Analysis
Users begin by answering a series of questions about their skin, including concerns such as dryness, oiliness, sensitivity, acne, or other specific conditions. This self-assessment helps determine the user’s skin type, allowing IngreScan to tailor recommendations accordingly.

2. Ingredient & Product Recommendations
Based on the analyzed skin type, IngreScan provides a list of recommended skincare products that are suitable for the user. It also highlights beneficial ingredients that can improve skin health while warning against harmful or unsuitable ingredients that might cause irritation or adverse reactions. This ensures that users make safe and informed choices when selecting skincare products.

3. Dermatologist Consultation (Optional)
For users who require expert advice, IngreScan offers the option to consult a dermatologist. This feature enables users to get personalized recommendations from a professional, ensuring better skincare decisions for more complex skin concerns.

4. Informed Decision-Making
After receiving recommendations, users can confidently choose skincare products that match their specific needs. The platform provides easy-to-understand explanations about why certain products or ingredients are suitable, making skincare choices simpler and more effective.

By following this process, IngreScan helps users navigate the overwhelming world of skincare with ease, ensuring that they choose the right products for their skin type while avoiding harmful ingredients.

## Libraries used
1.Node.js
2.React.js
## How to configure
1. **Setting up the Environment**:
   - I started by ensuring that node is installed on my computer. If not, I downloaded and installed node from the official website.
2. **Library Installation**:
   - Next, I used npm, node's package manager, to install the required libraries listed in the program. This command installs all the necessary libraries so that the program can run smoothly.
   - npm install
3. **File Paths**:
   - I checked that all the image files and resources referenced in the program exist in the specified locations. If needed, I adjusted the file paths in the code to match my project's directory structure.
5. **GUI Configuration**:
   - The program uses React for the graphical user interface. I reviewed the code to understand how the GUI elements are structured and customized them according to my preferences. This involved adjusting the layout, styling, and functionality of the GUI.
6. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - After configuring the program, I thoroughly tested it to ensure that all components work as expected. This included testing user interactions and any other functionalities. If I encountered any errors during testing, I debugged them and made necessary corrections.
7. **Running the Program**:
   - Once everything was configured and tested successfully, I ran the program by executing "npm run dev". This launched the program, and I was able to interact with it using the graphical user interface.
8. **Additional Customization**:
   - Depending on my specific requirements, I made additional customizations to the program. This could include adding new features, modifying existing functionalities, or integrating with other systems or services.

## How to Run
To run this program:
1. Setting Up the Backend (Node.js + TypeScript)
Step 1: Navigate to the Backend Folder
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Move to the backend project directory where your server files are located.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run the package manager command to install all required Node.js libraries and dependencies from the package.json file.

This ensures your backend has everything it needs to function properly.

Step 3: Start the Backend Server
Use the appropriate command to start the backend server in development mode.

Once started, the backend API should be running at http://localhost:5000 (or the configured port).

If the server runs successfully, it will display a message indicating that it is active and listening for requests.

2. Setting Up the Frontend (React + TypeScript)
Step 1: Navigate to the Frontend Folder
Open a new terminal window.

Move to the frontend project directory where your React files are located.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run the package manager command to install all required React and TypeScript libraries from the package.json file.

This ensures the frontend has all the necessary components and tools.

Step 3: Start the Frontend Application
Use the appropriate command to launch the React application in development mode.

The app should now be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:5173 (or another configured port).

If everything is set up correctly, the frontend should be able to communicate with the backend.

3. Testing & Verifying
Once both the frontend and backend are running, open a web browser and go to the frontend URL.

Ensure that data from the backend is being correctly fetched and displayed in the frontend.

Check the terminal or console for any error messages and resolve them if needed.
